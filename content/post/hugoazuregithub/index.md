This article is based on Microsoftâ€™s documentation -- [Use GitHub Actions workflow to deploy your static website in Azure Storage ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-static-site-github-actions?tabs=userlevel) --, but has been updated to reflect changes required to publish Hugo static sites to Azure blob storage/static web sites. Please see the article linked above for a list of prerequisites.

# Generate deployment credentials
Using Azure CLI
```
$azsubId="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
$azStrAcctResourceGroup="rg-westus2-website"
$azstorageacct="stgwestus2webstorageacct"
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $azstorageacct --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/$azsubId/resourceGroups/$azStrAcctResourceGroup --sdk-auth
```
The command will generate a JSON object, copy and save for later:
```
{
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
    "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
    "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
    "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
    "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
  }
```
# Configure the GitHub secret
1. In GitHub, browse our repository.
2. Select **Settings > Secrets > New secret**.
3. Paste the entire JSON output captured earlier. For secret name, use AZURE_CREDENTIALS
When you configure the workflow file later, you use the secret name for the input **creds** of the Azure Login action, for example:
```
- uses: azure/login@v1
with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
```
# Add your workflow
1. Go to Actions for your GitHub repository.
2. Select **Set up your workflow yourself**.
3. Delete everything from the workflow and replace with the following code block:
```
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Blob storage website CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
    - name: Upload to blob storage
      uses: azure/CLI@v1
      with:
        inlineScript: |
            az storage blob upload-batch --account-name yourstaticwebsitestorageaccount --auth-mode key -d '$web' -s ./public --overwrite
    - name: Purge CDN endpoint
      uses: azure/CLI@v1
      with:
        inlineScript: |
           az cdn endpoint purge --content-paths  "/*" --profile-name "thojotechwebcdn" --name "thojotechwebcdn" --resource-group "rg-eastus-thojotech-01" --no-wait
   
# Azure logout
    - name: logout
      run: |
            az logout
      if: always()
```
In the example above, notice the changes required for publishing Hugo static content, which uses a  **public** folder to store the static content. That is the folder we need to copy to Azure Blob storage.

Now, when you commit changes to your GitHub static website repository, the public folder will be copied to your Azure static web site blob storage automagically.
