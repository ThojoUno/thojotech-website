            I recently started scripting with Azure CLI within my Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment and tried to create a database on an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible-Server instance and received an error &#39;flexible-server&#39; is not in the &#39;az mysql&#39; command group. I also tried to list out the flexible-servers in my subscription, but it also give the same error!
I tried to see if maybe my Azure CLI was out of date, but it was already at the newest version!
